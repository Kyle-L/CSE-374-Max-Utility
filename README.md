## Overview
This is the repository for the development of a greedy algorithm that can apply utility maximization to a simple state machine based artificially intelligent agent. 
This algorithm was designed for [CSE 374](https://www.miamioh.edu/cec/academics/departments/cse/academics/course-descriptions/cse-374/index.html) at [Miami University](https://miamioh.edu) by Matthew Coe, Souyma Mitra, and Kyle Lierer. The repository contains a formal paper which details the specifics of the algorithm including the problem definition, literature review, our algorithm, a correctness proof of the algorithm, and a report of the algorithm's performance. Moreover, the repository also includes an implementation of our algorithm using Java 8.
